# Simplifying common tasks .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

For example: 

What commits were added to `<branch>` by my last `pull`?

--

```bash
git-show-new <branch>
```

---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

First, we need accept a `<branch>` arg

--

... and provide a sensible default if none supplied

--

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ $1 ]; then
  branch="$1"
else
  branch="HEAD"
fi
# ...
```

---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Next: generate the list of new commits

--

Use `git rev-list` 

--

It generates and traverses commit graphs


---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

General syntax for commits reachable from `A` but not `B`:

--

```bash
git rev-list A ^B
```

--

(`A`, `B` are [commit-ish](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html))


---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

General syntax for commits reachable from `A` but not `B`:

```bash
git rev-list A ^B
```

Could use alternate sytax...

```bash
git rev-list B..A
```

---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
git rev-list A ^B
```

--

In our case:

- `A` is the commit to which `<branch>` currently points

---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
git rev-list A ^B
```

In our case:

- `A` is the commit to which `<branch>` currently points

- `B` is the commit `<branch>` pointed to before our latest `pull`

---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

How do we specify the commit `<branch>` used to point to?

--

Using `@{<n>}` syntax:

--

```bash
<branch>@{<n>}
```

--

Gets the nth prior value of `<branch>`

---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Hence:

```bash
git rev-list <branch> ^<branch>@{1}
```

---

template: content

# List commits added to `<branch>` by last `pull` .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

A final version might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ $1 ]; then
  branch="$1"
else
  branch="HEAD"
fi

printf "\n%s%s\n\n" $(git rev-list $branch ^$branch@{1} | wc -l) \
  " commits were added by your last update to $branch:"
git --no-pager log $branch ^$branch@{1} --oneline
```

---

template: content

# Related advice .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

--

Be careful with Git's "convenience" syntax, e.g.`@`

--

```bash
BASE=$(git merge-base @ @{u} 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
```

--

*What are those `@` symbols?!*

--

*Those are the Unicode code points for the "the Git command line was getting too comprehensible" character in Swahili*

---

template: content

# Avoid Git syntax shortcuts in scripts .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
BASE=$(git merge-base @ @{u} 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
```

--

- the `@` is short for `HEAD`


---

template: content

# Avoid Git syntax shortcuts in scripts .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
BASE=$(git merge-base @ @{u} 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
```
  
- the `@` is short for `HEAD`

- `@{u}` is short for `@{upstream}`

---

template: content

# Avoid Git syntax shortcuts in scripts .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
BASE=$(git merge-base @ @{u} 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
```
  
- the `@` is short for `HEAD`

- `@{u}` is short for `@{upstream}`

*Using that in scripting is a terrible idea, IMHO.*

---

template: content

# Avoid Git syntax shortcuts in scripts .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Git can be tricky enough as is 

--

Make scripts reader-friendly where possible

--

```diff
-BASE=$(git merge-base @ @{u} 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
+BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD @{upstream} 2>/dev/null || echo "none")
```

# Moving history - scenario .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

2 separate repos, each with history

--

Import `<subdir>` from `<source-repo>` into `<target-repo>`

--

(and preserve history of `<subdir>`)

---

# Moving history - scenario .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

---

template: content

# Moving history  .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Step 1: construct a "synthetic" history

--

(all commits in `<source-repo>` that touch files in `<subdir>`)

--

In `<source-repo>`:

```bash
git subtree split --branch <branch> --prefix <subdir>
```

---

template: content

# Moving history .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
git subtree split --branch <branch> --prefix <subdir>
```

---

template: content

# Moving history .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
git subtree split --branch <branch> --prefix <subdir>
```

- creates a new branch

---

template: content

# Moving history .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
git subtree split --branch <branch> --prefix <subdir>
```

- creates a new branch
- synthesizes commit history

---

template: content

# Moving history .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
git subtree split --branch <branch> --prefix <subdir>
```

- creates a new branch
- synthesizes commit history
  - each commit has contents of `<subdir>` at root of project
  - repeated splits produce identical histories

---

template: content

# Moving history .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Step 2: get contents of `<subdir>` into `<target-repo>`:

--

In `<target-repo>`:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix <subdir> <source-repo> <branch>
```

---

template: content

# Moving history .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

```bash
git subtree add --prefix <subdir> <source-repo> <branch>
```

--

- imports synthetic history, puts contents into `<subdir>`

---

template: content

# Moving history - caveats .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Done...with some caveats

--

`git log` may not work as you expect

---

template: content

# Moving history - caveats .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Look at the history of a given`<file>` in `<subdir>`:

--

In `<target-repo>`:

```bash
>>> git log -- <subdir>/<file>
commit 2e259f35fea13ca6bbfb8bd33be6476caea5cc86
Merge: e6a4851 d0e7410

    Add '<subdir>' from commit 'd0e74107e4517e48888b3de5bd7b129bc12a041f'
    
    git-subtree-dir: <subdir>
    git-subtree-mainline: e6a4851ca13c9fa76fd25277b1d1bb6cd7e61519
    git-subtree-split: d0e74107e4517e48888b3de5bd7b129bc12a041f
>>>
```

--

Only 1 commit&mdash;didn't we import the full history?

---

template: content

# Moving history - caveats .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

Adding `--follow` doesn't help

--

There's a workaround:

--

```bash
git log -- *<file>
```

--

But limitations to this

---

template: content

# Moving history - v2 .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

In `<target-repo>`:

--

```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
```

---

template: content

# Moving history - v2 .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

In `<target-repo>`:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
git remote add  -f <remote-name> <source-repo>
```

---

template: content

# Moving history - v2 .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

In `<target-repo>`:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
git remote add  -f <remote-name> <source-repo>
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories <remote-name>/<branch>
```

--

`git log -- <pathname>` should now work as expected

---

template: content

# Moving history - general notes .octicon.octicon-circuit-board[]

`filter-branch` generalizes better (to processing all branches)...

--

... but it is *notoriously tricky to use*

--

`subtree` simpler...

--

... but it lives in `/contrib` (while `filter-branch` ships with Git)
